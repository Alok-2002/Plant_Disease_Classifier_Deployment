# Plant Disease Classifier Frontend

Welcome to the Plant Disease Classifier Deployment repository! This project integrates cutting-edge technologies to develop a sophisticated plant disease classifier. Leveraging TensorFlow for model creation and ReactJS for the web interface, this project offers an innovative solution for identifying plant diseases swiftly and accurately.

## Project Overview

Plant diseases pose significant threats to agricultural productivity worldwide. Timely detection and diagnosis are essential for effective disease management. This project addresses these challenges by employing advanced machine learning techniques to classify plant images and provide insights into their health status.

## Key Components

### 1. TensorFlow Model

The heart of this project is a state-of-the-art machine learning model built with TensorFlow. Trained on a diverse dataset of plant images, the model can accurately classify plants into various disease categories, enabling rapid and precise diagnosis.

### 2. ReactJS Web Interface

The project features a sleek and intuitive web interface developed using ReactJS. Users can effortlessly upload images of plants via the interface, allowing the deployed model to analyze them promptly. The interface offers a seamless user experience, making plant disease classification accessible to all.

### 3. Deployment
